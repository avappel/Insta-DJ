# INSTA DJ

NOTES: We used node.js for this project.


## Loading the app
After downloading or cloning the repository, navigate to the insta_dj directory inside 09-final-project-yash_alex, and run 
```node app.js```. The app should then load on localhost:8888. 

## Using the app
NOTE: You need to have a Spotify Premium account in order to be a host in this app.

### Host a room

NOTE: The Spotify Web player does not work in all browsers. If no audio plays, make sure you are using an approved browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Opera). 

If you have a Spotify Premium account and you would like to host an Insta DJ room, click on "Create a Room" on the home page. You can search for songs and add them to your queue, and your device will play the audio that is in the shared queue amongst all the users of the room.


### Join an existing room

If you would like to join an existing room, type in the your hosts room id code in the text box, and click "Join Room". You can search for songs and add them to your queue, and the hosts device will play the audio that is in the shared queue.
